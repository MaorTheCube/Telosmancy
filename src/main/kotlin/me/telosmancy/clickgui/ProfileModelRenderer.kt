/**
 * Provides the rotating 3D player model shown in the profile sidebar.
 *
 * When viewing your own profile the live [mc.player] is used so the real skin and held items show.
 * For anyone else a lightweight [RemotePlayer] dummy is built. A plain dummy's [getSkin] resolves
 * through the tab-list ([AbstractClientPlayer.getPlayerInfo]), which is only populated for players
 * on the same server, so for offline players it would fall back to a default skin. To fix that we
 * resolve the full textured profile from the UUID via Mojang and override [getSkin] to read the
 * skin straight from the skin manager.
 *
 * The model is submitted through vanilla's inventory entity renderer, so it must be drawn from the
 * GUI render pass rather than inside the NanoVG picture-in-picture lambda.
